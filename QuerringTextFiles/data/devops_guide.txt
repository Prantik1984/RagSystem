DevOps Deployment Guide 

1. Build Pipeline Overview
   - The pipeline uses TeamCity as the CI server.
   - The codebase is stored in GitLab.
   - All commits trigger automated static code analysis and unit tests.

2. Security Scanning
   - Gitleaks is used for secret scanning.
   - SonarQube performs SAST checks.
   - OWASP Dependency Check performs software composition analysis (SCA).
   - Checkov and Trivy run as part of IaC scanning and container scanning.

3. Deployment Workflow
   - Upon successful build, artifacts are stored in Nexus Repository.
   - Deployment to staging occurs automatically.
   - Deployment to production requires approval from the Release Manager.

4. Rollback Procedure
   - Rollback can be triggered by redeploying the last successful artifact.
   - Logs are stored centrally via ELK stack for analysis.
